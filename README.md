### Imagine This:

You’re preparing for an important job interview, but instead of practicing in front of a mirror or with a friend, you slip on your Apple Vision Pro headset. Instantly, you’re transported to a lifelike office environment.

#### A Welcoming Reception

- **Arrival at the Office**: As the scene loads, you find yourself standing at a sleek, modern reception desk. The ambient noise of a bustling office fills the air.

- **Dynamic Response**: You respond, "I'm applying for a Technical Mechanic." The receptionist acknowledges your response, "Oh, I see your appointment right here. Follow me this way."

#### Walking Through the Office

#### The Interview Room

- **Entering the Room**: You enter a professional-looking interview room. The interviewer, sitting behind a polished desk, stands to greet you. The atmosphere is calm yet serious, with light streaming through the windows casting natural shadows.
- **Taking Your Seat**: As you sit down, the room adjusts to give you a perfect view of the interviewer. The eye-tracking feature kicks in, ensuring that the app monitors your eye contact and engagement levels.

#### The Interview Begins

- **Engaging Questions**: The interviewer asks, "Are you ready to begin, Mr./Ms. [Your Name]?" You respond affirmatively, and the first question is asked. Thanks to the integration with ChatGPT, the questions are dynamically generated based on the position you mentioned, ensuring a unique and relevant experience every time.

### Analyzing Performance

### Post-Interview Feedback

- **Comprehensive Report**: Once the interview is over, you receive a detailed report. It highlights your strengths and areas for improvement. For example, "Your eyes were wandering too much during the questions about technical skills. Try to maintain eye contact to show confidence."
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: The app offers personalized suggestions, such as "You had a great start with the first question, but you could improve by being more concise. Avoid using filler words and focus on delivering clear, concise answers."
